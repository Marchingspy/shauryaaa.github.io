 <h6 class="about-data">I'm a student of <i>'Computer Science & Engineering at RV college '</i> who is trying to explore new tech!<br>
        I like meeting new people, because it is always a baffling experience for me to understand how differently humans can think. <br>
        also maybe because communcication is a strong point for me.<br> and maybe I am a little bit of extrovert too :P</h6>
